    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The writings of Thomas More were scarce in 1914 when J. S. Phillimore
wrote his preface to the
<a href="https://archive.org/details/commentaryonseve01fishuoft">Manresa Press edition</a>
of the sermons of St John Fisher on the seven Penitential Psalms:</p>

<p><blockquote><p></p></p><p><p>The young student who swallows what his hand books tell him is never allowed to suspect that More&rsquo;s English works fill 1400 pages of folio. Or suppose him to have learned this much (for the literary histories mention it), he is little the forwarder.  There is hardly a possibility of his reading them.  Since 1557 there has never been a complete reprint; and only three pieces, I think, have been reprinted at all.</p></p><p><p></p><footer><strong>J. S. Phillimore <a href="https://archive.org/stream/commentaryonseve01fishuoft#page/n11/mode/1up">https://archive.org/stream/commentaryonseve01fishuoft#page/n11/mode/1up</a></strong></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>Yale University published the works of More in a
<a href="http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/SeriesPage.asp?Series=86">scholarly edition of 15 volumes</a>
between 1963 and 1997, but 15 volumes at about $100 per volume comes
to way too damn much for me to pay.</p>

<p>The 1557 edition (funky spelling, gothic type, crappy printing, &amp;c.)
is on the web
<a href="http://www.thomasmorestudies.org/library.html#compworks">here</a> at the
<a href="http://www.thomasmorestudies.org">Center for Thomas More Studies</a> at
the <a href="http://udallas.edu/">University of Dallas</a>.  There&rsquo;s a
transcription &amp; translation job there for a young scholar with a
steady eye and an iron butt.</p>
